# Guardrail UI

Welcome! This is a demonstration of how your documented UI components library would look.



---

## Getting started
All you have to do to install your UI library in your React project is to run this command:

```
npm i guardrail-ui-demo
```

And that's it!

### Using your library

You got this. Just import the component you need and use it. You can see usage examples in each component's documentation page.

```jsx
import { SideBar } from 'guardrail-ui-demo'

<>
   <SideBar items={ items } favorites={ favorites } />
</>
```
